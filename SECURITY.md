# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Time and computers move on. We do not have the resources to support every ancient version of everything
(unless you'd like to pay us to do so.)  We ONLY support the latest stable release and development releases.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.34.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.35.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.34.x   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since sometimes security vulnerabilities can be sensitive, you can just email me at isaac@zoneminder.com.
If it's not such a big deal, by all means, create an issue here on github
