Windows 10+ using WSL
=======================

With Windows 10, Microsoft released the `Window Subsystem for Linux (WSL) <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq>`__  that enables you to run native Linux tools directly on Windows, alongside your traditional Windows desktop and modern store apps. To install WSL, please refer to the 
`installation guide from Microsoft <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10>`__.

ZoneMinder now runs on Windows 10+ systems which have WSL enabled. This guide will explain how to go about installing an Ubuntu ZM image on Windows 10+.
